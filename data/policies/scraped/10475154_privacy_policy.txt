Information We Collect From You and How We Use ItYOUR CONSENTBy using, visiting, or interacting with the Website and Online Services or providing personal information to us through your use of the Website and Online Services, you are consenting to the collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information described in this Privacy Statement.If you do not consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information as described in this Privacy Statement, do not use the Website or contact us as described in Section 6 below.ACTIVE INFORMATION COLLECTIONLike many other websites, we actively collect information from our visitors by permitting you to communicate directly with us via Investor Relations “Email Notifications” forms,  recruiting and employment forms, or other methods made available to you on our Website and Online Services. Some of the information that you submit may be personal information (that is, information that can be uniquely identified with you, such as your name, address, e-mail address, phone number, etc.). We use this information for the purposes for which you provide it and for any other purpose described at the time information is submitted by you, as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Statement, or as permitted or required by applicable law.We generally collect and use personal information provided to us on the Website and Online Services for the following purposes:to respond to your inquiries;to allow individuals to apply for employment with us;to authenticate identity for privacy-related requests;to ensure the efficiency, reliability, and security of our systems;to meet legal and regulatory requirements and to allow us to meet contractual requirements relating to our products and services;to understand and assess the interests, wants, and changing needs of Website visitors with a view to improving our products and services and developing new ones; andto notify Website visitors about changes to the Website and Online Services.PASSIVE INFORMATION COLLECTIONSome of the information we collect depends on the settings on your web browser or mobile device. Please check your web browser or mobile device if you want to learn what information your browser or mobile device sends or how to change your settings. In addition to the information sent by your web browser or mobile device, as you navigate through a website or mobile app, certain information can be passively collected (that is, gathered without you actively providing the information) using various technologies and means, such as navigational data collection.Like most website operators, we and our approved partners use cookies and similar technologies, local shared objects (or any other successor tracker technology), Software Development Kits, and pixel tags that automatically receive and track certain data about how you and other visitors interact with our Website and Online Services, preferences expressed, and settings chosen. For example, we may collect information about the technology you use (such as browser, type of computer, operating systems, mobile device and network used, and Internet service providers) and server log data (such as access dates and times, online features or pages viewed, system activity, and the third-party site or service you were using before interacting with our Website). These technologies are described in more detail below.“Cookies” are small text files that are stored on your browser or device by websites, mobile apps, online media, and advertisements. There are different types of cookies. Cookies served by the entity that operates the website or app you are visiting or using are called “first party cookies” (so cookies served by us while you are using our Website are first party cookies). Cookies served by companies that are not operating the website or app you are visiting or using are called “third party cookies” (so, a website analytics provider may set a cookie on your computer via our Website while you visit our Website). Cookies may also endure for different periods of time. “Session Cookies” last only as long as your browser or app is open. These are deleted automatically once you close your browser or app. Other cookies are “persistent cookies” meaning that they survive after your browser or app is closed (for example, they may recognize your computer when you re-open our online services).“Local shared objects” (also called Flash cookies or HTML5 cookies) and any other successor technology refers generally to the collection of cookie-like data stored on a browser or computer by web sites, ads, or third parties. “Pixel tags” (also called beacons or pixels) are small blocks of code installed on (or called by) a web page, app, or advertisement which can retrieve certain information about your device and browser, including device type, operating system, browser type and version, web site visited, time of visit, referring web site, IP address, and other similar information (including the small text file (the cookie) that uniquely identifies the device). Pixels provide the means by which third parties can set and read browser cookies from a domain that they do not themselves operate and collect information about visitors to that domain, typically with the permission of the domain owner. “Software Development Kits” (also called SDKs) function like pixels and cookies but operate in the mobile app context where pixels and cookies cannot always function. The primary app developer can install pieces of code (the SDK) from partners in the app, thereby allowing such partners to collect certain information about user interaction with the app, information about the user device, and network information.In this Privacy Statement, these and similar technologies are collectively referred to as “cookies and technologies.” The following table sets out the different categories of cookies and technologies that our Website and Online Services may use and why we use them:Cookie TypesPurposeAnalytics and ResearchThese cookies and technologies are used to understand, improve, and research our Website and Online Services, and better understand the interests of people who interact with our Website and Online Services. For example, we and our approved partners may use these cookies and technologies to understand how you are using Website features, and segmenting audiences for feature testing. We and our partners may use these technologies and the information we receive to improve and understand how you use and interact with our Website and Online Services.For example, our Website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses cookies to analyze use patterns and may collect information about your use of our Website. More information on Google Analytics can be found here:. If you would like to opt-out of having your data used by these cookies, please use the Google Analytics opt-out available here:.INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM OTHER SOURCESWe may also receive information from other sources and combine it with information we collect through our Website and Online Services.

This information may include your name, demographic information, interests, and public data (such as social media and shopping behavior).RETENTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATIONWe retain the personal information collected on the Website and Online Services as long as necessary to provide the services, products, and information you request or as permitted by applicable law.Disclosure of Personal InformationWe will not sell or otherwise disclose personal information collected from the Website and Online Services to any third person, except as permitted by this Privacy Statement, as permitted or provided by applicable law, or with your consent.We may disclose personal information you provide to us via this Website and Online Services or that we collect through your use of the Website and Online Services as follows:to affiliates, business partners, service providers, and contractors who support our business, in which case we will limit the amount of information disclosed to that which is necessary in order for them to provide the services or products we have engaged them to provide. We will strive to protect personal information rendered accessible by contractual agreements requiring confidentiality and security practices that help keep data inaccessible to others;to respond to law enforcement requests, where required by applicable laws, court orders, or governmental regulations;in the event of a sale, merger, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization, assignment, or other transfer of our business to which the information relates, in which case we will require any such buyer to agree to treat it in accordance with this Privacy Statement and use it for the same purposes as we are entitled to do so under this Privacy Statement; andto report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we, in good faith, believe to be unlawful, and in situations involving threats of physical safety of any person or when we believe that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect our rights and property.We are not liable for disclosure of information obtained due to errors in transmission or the unauthorized intervention of third parties.We may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, online traffic patterns, and related information to reputable third parties, but these statistics will not include any personally identifying information.We may transfer the information described in this Privacy Statement to, and process and store it in, the United States and other countries, some of which may have less protective data protection laws than the region in which you reside. Where this is the case, we will take appropriate measures to protect your information in accordance with this Privacy Statement. Nonetheless, your personal information may be subject to foreign laws and may be accessible by foreign government authorities, courts, law enforcement, and regulatory agencies.2.

You may need to take additional steps to delete or disable Flash cookies.You can also generally opt-out of receiving personalized ads from third party advertisers and ad networks that honor such requests by visiting:(if you are in the United States),(if you are in Canada), or(if you are in Europe).DO NOT TRACK:Some web browsers may transmit “do-not-track” signals to websites with which the browser communicates. Our Website and Online Services do not currently respond to these “do-not-track” signals.3. How We Protect Your InformationWe work hard to protect your personal information.
