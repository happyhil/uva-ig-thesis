 Uses and Disclosures for Public Health Activities
 Facilities may 
use or 
disclose
 PHI for public health activities 
and purposes to:
 
¥ A public health authority that is authorized by law to collect or receive such information 
for the purpose of preventing or controlling disease, injury or disability;
 ¥ At the direction of a public health authority, to an official of a forei
gn government agency 
that is acting in collaboration with a public health authority;
 ¥ A public health authority or other appropriate government authority authorized by law to 
receive reports of child ab
use
 or neglect;
 ¥ A person subject to the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) with respect to an FDA
-regulated product or activity for which the person has responsibility, for the purpose of 
activities related to q
uality, safety or effectiveness;
 ¥ A person who may have been exposed to a communicable disease or ma
y be at risk of 
contracting or spreading a disease or condition, if the Facility or public health authority is 
authorized by law to notify the person as necessary in the conduct of a public health 
intervention or investigation;
 ¥ An employer about a member o
f the employerÕs workforce if the Facility is a covered 
health care provider who provides health care to the individual at the request of the 
employer:  (1) to conduct an evaluation relating to medical surveillance of the workplace, 
or (2) to evaluate whet
her the individual has a work
-related illness or injury.  The 
PHI disclose
d must be limited to findings concerning a work
-related illness or injury or a 
workplace
-related medical surveillance. The employer must need the findings to comply 
with legal obliga
tions to record the illness or injury to carry out responsibilities for 
workplace medical surveillance.  The Facility must provide written notice to the 
individual that 
PHI relating to the medical surveillance of the workplace and work
-related 
illnesses an
d injuries is 
disclose
d to the employer, either by giving written notice when 
the health care is provided or if the health care is provided at the work site, by posting the 
notice in a prominent place where the health care is provided.
 ¥ A school about an individual who is a student or prospective student of the school if:  (1)  
the PHI that is disclosed is limited to proof of immunization; (2) the school is required by 
state or other law to have such proof prior to admitting the individua
l; and (3) the Facility 
obtains and documents 
the 
agreement to the disclosure from the individual (if the student 
is an adult or emancipated minor) or, where the individual is an unemancipated minor, 
from a parent, guardian or other person acting 
in loco p
arentis 
of the individual.
  The 
agreement may be an oral agreement to disclose the immunization records.  
Documentation will make clear that agreement was obtained for the disclosure.  For 
example, if the parent of an unemancipated minor called to request 
the Facility forward 
their childÕs immunization records to the school, a notation would be made in the childÕs 
medical record or elsewhere of the phone call.  The agreement to permit disclosure of 
immunization records is considered effective until it is re
voked.
