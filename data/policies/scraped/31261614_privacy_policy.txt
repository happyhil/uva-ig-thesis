There is no industry standard for how Do Not Track consumer browser settings should work on commercial websites. Due to the lack of such standards our websites do not respond to Do Not Track consumer browser settings.We use trusted service providers, such as advertising and media companies to collect information about use of the Services anonymously and report website trends, without identifying individual visitors. Those third parties use cookies and other similar technologies.Occasionally, you may encounter banner advertisements for our products and services on third-party websites and mobile applications. We use third-party advertising service providers to distribute our advertisements on websites and mobile applications where we have paid to advertise. These advertisements may use tracking technologies to capture information such as IP address, browser type and usage information in order to track the effectiveness of our advertising efforts. We may associate the information collected by these technologies with your identity. Our advertising service providers are prohibited from using any information collected except to track advertising effectiveness.In addition, we use advertising service providers to place advertisements for our accounts and services on websites not affiliated with us, and to help us determine which of our advertisements are most likely to be of interest to you using non-personal behavioral information. Advertisements placed by these service providers may use tracking technologies that allow monitoring of your responsiveness to such advertisements. We restrict access and collection of information by advertising service providers for purposes other than assisting us with our advertising efforts.U.S. Bank participates in the industry Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising managed by the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA). As part of this service, U.S. Bank online advertisements are sometimes delivered with icons that help consumers understand how data about them is being used. Clicking on the icon provides options for consumers who want more control and the ability to opt out of such behavioral (targeted) advertising. Our service providers may use data collected on our website to customize advertisements to you on other sites as you browse the web. You can click on the DAA icon in our targeted advertisements to opt out if you do not want your browsing behavior used for online behavioral advertising purposes. If you prefer not to have non-personal information used for online behavioral advertising purposes, you may also opt-out here. Please note that even if you opt-out, you may still receive online advertising fromU.S. Bank.Opting-out from a specific advertising provider means that the ads you do receive will not be based on your preferences or behavior. You may still see targeted pages based on your habits as you navigate www.usbank.com.In order for behavioral advertising opt-outs to work on your device, your browser must be set to accept cookies. If you delete cookies, buy a new device, access the Services from a different device, log-in under a different screen name or change web browsers, you will need to opt-out again. If your browser has scripting disabled, you do not need to opt-out, as online behavioral advertising technology does not work when scripting is disabled.
