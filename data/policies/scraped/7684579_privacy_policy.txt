Broadband internet access is more important than ever to education, employment, healthcare, and daily life. Yet tens of millions of households and businesses – especially among vulnerable communities and in rural areas – still lack access or have not adopted broadband internet service. With a new year, a new Congress, and a new Administration, the time is ripe to comprehensively address this divide.Our Impact Across AmericaCharter is at the intersection of technology and entertainment, facilitating essential communications that connect more than 31 million residential and business customers in 41 states.Download ouror click on a state to see our local impact:‌Filter By State:NationalAlabamaArizonaCaliforniaColoradoConnecticutFloridaGeorgiaHawaiiIdahoIllinoisIndianaKansasKentuckyLouisianaMassachusettsMarylandMaineMichiganMinnesotaMissouriMississippiMontanaNorth CarolinaNebraskaNew HampshireNew JerseyNew MexicoNevadaNew YorkOhioOregonPennsylvaniaRhode IslandSouth CarolinaTennesseeTexasVirginiaVermontWashingtonWisconsinWest VirginiaWyomingCharter in the USMore than 31MCustomers Served41States Served96,000EmployeesOver the lastthreeyears, we've extended our network to provide broadband to more than2.5 millionhomes and business, about a third in rural areas.Charter in Alabama624,000Customers Served233Communities Served1,078EmployeesCharter in Arizona62,000Customers Served6Communities Served59EmployeesCharter in California5.1Million Customers Served268Communities Served8,848EmployeesCharter in Colorado127,000Customers Served57Communities Served5,010EmployeesCharter in Connecticut124,000Customers Served37Communities Served1,660EmployeesCharter in Florida2.8Million Customers Served160Communities Served9,251EmployeesCharter in Georgia432,000Customers Served137Communities Served654EmployeesCharter in Hawaii467,000Customers Served9Communities Served1,230EmployeesCharter in Idaho60,000Customers Served16Communities Served52EmployeesCharter in Illinois200,000Customers Served91Communities Served185EmployeesCharter in Indiana322,000Customers Served81Communities Served444EmployeesCharter in Kansas132,000Customers Served25Communities Served249EmployeesCharter in Kentucky788,000Customers Served317Communities Served3,202EmployeesCharter in Louisiana163,000Customers Served43Communities Served268EmployeesCharter in Massachusetts325,000Customers Served75Communities Served652EmployeesCharter in Maryland2,000Customers Served2Communities Served7EmployeesCharter in Maine448,000Customers Served293Communities Served680EmployeesCharter in Michigan908,000Customers Served809Communities Served1,678EmployeesCharter in Minnesota356,000Customers Served168Communities Served1,003EmployeesCharter in Missouri856,000Customers Served291Communities Served6,569EmployeesCharter in Mississippi10,000Customers Served2Communities ServedCharter in Montana248,000Customers Served55Communities Served610EmployeesCharter in North Carolina2.7Million Customers Served486Communities Served11,215EmployeesCharter in Nebraska180,000Customers Served89Communities Served282EmployeesCharter in New Hampshire76,000Customers Served57Communities Served85EmployeesCharter in New Jersey52,000Customers Served14Communities Served97EmployeesCharter in New Mexico6,000Customers Served3Communities Served1EmployeeCharter in Nevada206,000Customers Served14Communities Served307EmployeesCharter in New York3.5Million Customers Served1,136Communities Served10,824EmployeesCharter in Ohio2.7Million Customers Served1,743Communities Served7,608EmployeesCharter in Oregon276,000Customers Served97Communities Served338EmployeesCharter in Pennsylvania135,000Customers Served88Communities Served139EmployeesCharter in South Carolina914,000Customers Served152Communities Served3,254EmployeesCharter in Tennessee508,000Customers Served214Communities Served821EmployeesCharter in Texas3.4Million Customers Served404Communities Served12,603EmployeesCharter in Virginia73,000Customers Served46Communities Served108EmployeesCharter in Vermont17,000Customers Served30Communities Served20EmployeesCharter in Washington215,000Customers Served59Communities Served891EmployeesCharter in Wisconsin1.5 MillionCustomers Served791Communities Served3,843EmployeesCharter in West Virginia24,000Customers Served12Communities Served38EmployeesCharter in Wyoming124,000Customers Served36Communities Served188EmployeesPolicy News & UpdatesSpectrum InternetSpectrum Internetarticle:Fast, reliable connectivity is more important than ever,” said Carl Leuschner, Senior Vice President, Internet & Voice Products at Charter.
