Trust is the foundation of the relationships Caterpillar has with its employees, suppliers, dealers, customers and all others. We collect and process only personal information needed or appropriate for business purposes, and do so only by lawful and fair means. This Privacy Statement is meant to help you understand what personal data we collect, why we collect it, and what we do with it. We hope you take time to read it carefully.|||||||||||||||||Caterpillar Global Data Privacy StatementEffective Date: May 25, 2018Updated: July 14, 2020This Privacy Statement describes how Caterpillar collects, stores, uses, and transfers personal information. This Privacy Statement reflects the values and principles expressed in Our Values in Action (Caterpillar’s Worldwide Code of Conduct).Expand AllSection 1. What is the scope of this document?This Privacy Statement applies to the Caterpillar subsidiaries, affiliates, and other entities controlled by Caterpillar Inc. as are identified inSchedule A(List of Caterpillar Data Controllers / Legal Entities) (collectively, “Caterpillar”). This Privacy Statement applies only when Caterpillar is collecting or otherwise processing personal information for Caterpillar’s purposes (i.e., when Caterpillar (either alone or in common with other entities) is a controller and therefore determines the purposes for which and the manner in which any personal information is processed). This Privacy Statement does not apply when Caterpillar is collecting or otherwise processing personal information on behalf of another company, such as Caterpillar’s dealers, suppliers, and customers.The applicable Caterpillar entity that is the “controller” of your data is the one with which you have a relationship, including for example: as a customer (e.g., the Caterpillar company referred to in your purchase order or other agreement with Caterpillar), an employee (e.g., the Caterpillar company that you are attempting to or have entered into a relationship with), or a supplier (e.g., the Caterpillar company that you are attempting to or have entered into a supplier relationship with). Caterpillar encourages the periodic review of this Privacy Statement to stay aware of any changes it.For convenience, in several sections this Privacy Statement is organized by the category of data subjects identified below. Please note that in some situations, you may not fit perfectly into any one category (for example, more than one could apply, or you might not be a customer of Caterpillar, yet the customer section is the most applicable). Please review all of the language that is appropriate to your relationship with Caterpillar. This Privacy Statement covers the personal information of individuals who are:Caterpillar candidates for employment or employees (meaning staff, personnel, and workers) or other persons currently or formerly employed to perform work for Caterpillar, including temporary employees (collectively, “employees”);Associated with Caterpillar’s customers, including dealers, dealers’ customers, distributors, distributors’ customers, direct sale customers, sales representatives and other resellers (collectively, “customers”); andAssociated with suppliers of Caterpillar, such as suppliers’ employees (temporary workers, staff, personnel, and contractors, etc.) (collectively, “suppliers”).In this Privacy Statement, the term “processing” means any activity performed on personal information, including, for example, collecting, storing, modifying, transferring or otherwise using it. Additionally, this Privacy Statement does not apply to other information (non-Personal Information) that Caterpillar may collect or otherwise process. For more information on other information that Caterpillar may collect or otherwise process, please see Caterpillar’s Data Governance Statement.In addition to this Privacy Statement, some Caterpillar systems, applications, and processes may contain their own privacy notices, which provide additional details about what specific personal information is collected and how it is stored, used, and transferred.Certain jurisdictions may prohibit or limit the collection, use or sharing of specific categories of personal information; accordingly, this Privacy Statement describing our practices may be limited by those laws and/or further clarified in any country-specific appendices applicable to you and attached to this Privacy Statement. When in conflict with this Privacy Statement, those appendices control.Section 2.

This de-identified information is not considered personal information for purposes of this Privacy Statement and is not covered by this Privacy Statement.
