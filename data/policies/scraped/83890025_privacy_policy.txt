The need to                                             verify an individual’s identity is critical to protecting your information,                                             and ensuring that your information is not shared with anyone pretending to                                             be you or someone who is not authorized to act as your agent on your behalf.You may submit a verifiable request via our website or toll-free number,                                             listed in the "How to Contact Us for CCPA Requests" section below, or as                                             otherwise provided on our Website (if such means are available).

This information may include your                                             name, your address, your account information, and any other information                                             deemed necessary by AutoZone to reasonably verify your identity, to ensure                                             that your information is not shared with anyone impersonating you.We may ask for additional information if we have difficulty confirming your                                             identity. We will not share your information or honor other requests in                                             those situations in which we are unable to confirm a request for your                                             information is a "verifiable request."Under California law a consumer can appoint an "authorized agent" to make                                             certain verifiable requests upon their behalf, such as the right to know                                             what information we collect about the consumer or to request deletion of the                                             consumer’s information. Because the security and privacy of your information                                             is paramount, we will ask that you identify and provide permissionin                                                 writingfor such persons to act as your authorized agent and                                             exercise your applicable rights under California law in such situations.                                             This may require us to contact you directly and alert you that an individual                                             has claimed to be your agent and is attempting to access or delete your                                             information. We will also independently verify your identity to ensure that                                             an unauthorized person is not attempting to impersonate you and exercise                                             your rights without authorization. We will not share your information or                                             honor any other requests in those situations where you cannot or do not                                             grant permission in writing for an identified authorized agent to act on                                             your behalf, or where we cannot independently verify your identity.How to Contact Us for CCPA RequestsIf you have questions about this Privacy Policy, the practices of this site                                             or your dealings with this site, please contact AutoZone:By Website:By telephone: (866) 246-5230SIGN IN AND COOKIESSign InYou can sign in manually or automatically.

The need to                                             verify an individual’s identity is critical to protecting your information                                             and ensuring that your information is not shared with anyone pretending to                                             be you or someone who is not authorized to act as your agent on your behalf.You may submit a verifiable request via our website or toll-free number                                             listed in the “How to Contact Us for CCPA Requests” section below or as                                             otherwise provided on our Websites and Apps (if such means are available).                                             AutoZone will ask you to provide information about yourself so that we can                                             verify your identity as part of this process. This information may include                                             your name, your address, your account information, and any other information                                             deemed necessary by AutoZone to reasonably verify your identity, to ensure                                             that your information is not shared with anyone impersonating you. Once we                                             have verified your identity, we will work to fulfill your request in a                                             timely manner. Please note there may be some situations in which we are                                             unable to fulfill your request, such as if we cannot find any information                                             about you within your systems. Additionally, we may not be able to honor a                                             deletion request in some situations, such as if your information is                                             necessary to fulfill your order with us or meet a legal obligation. We will                                             inform you whether we can fulfill your rights request.We may ask for additional information if we have difficulty confirming your                                             identity.

This may require us to contact you directly and alert you that an individual                                             has claimed to be your agent and is attempting to access or delete your                                             information.

These cores are then remanufactured (recycled) by                                         companies to original equipment specifications. Remanufacturing is the process                                         of taking used parts, completely disassembling and thoroughly cleaning them,                                         replacing the faulty and/or worn components with original quality components,                                         and restoring them to their original function. The testing and procedures are                                         the same as the original equipment manufacturers.Your shipment or                                         other return of any core or other product to AutoZone or AutoZone.com is                                         considered a transfer of ownership, and AutoZone will be unable to return the                                         core or other product to you.Core Return to an AutoZone                                     storeTo return a core to an AutoZone store, simply take the                                         product, in its original packaging and/or box, to the store of your choice along                                         with your receipt. You must drain all fluids, if any, from the product before                                         returning it.* AutoZone recommends that you take the credit card used to                                         purchase the new product so the store can credit your card for the value of the                                         core, assuming the core passes inspection. If you do not have the credit card,                                         or you purchased the product with Paypal or another payment method, simply                                         present your receipt, and upon the core passing the inspection, the store will                                         reimburse your account for the value of the returned core.OneIf                                         the core does not pass inspection, you will not be reimbursed for it and the                                         core will be returned to you.TwoCore Return to                                     AutoZone.com's Fulfillment CenterTo return a core to AutoZone.com's Fulfillment                                         Center, first drain all fluids, if any, from the product.* Then fill out the                                         Return Form (found in Section B of your Shipping Invoice) and include it along                                         with the core in the original packaging and/or box in which your new product was                                         sent.You will not be reimbursed for shipping costs incurred in                                         shipping the core to AutoZone.com's Fulfillment Center.

If you do not have the credit                                         card, or you purchased with Paypal or another payment method, simply enclose a                                         copy of your receipt and the product, and AutoZone.com will credit your account                                         in the amount of the value of the core.

Forced labor                                 includes, but is not limited to, all forms of slavery or practices similar to slavery,                                 bonded labor, involuntary labor resulting from trafficking, and labor subject to                                 arbitrary abuse.AutoZone expects its supply chain network to be security                                 compliant. Our vendors are expected to meet or exceed industry standards and comply with                                 policies related to container security, access and loading processes, seal management,                                 and human resources practices, and such other security standards as AutoZone may direct                                 from time to time. AutoZone does not allow illegal payments to any person, organization,                                 or government. Vendors must not give funds, property, services or labor, directly or                                 indirectly, to anyone in order to obtain business or any special or unusual treatment                                 for AutoZone. This includes vendors and their agents, representatives, employees,                                 officers and directors, and U.S. or foreign officials or                                 agents.AutoZone Domestic Sourced Products:AutoZone’s                                 vendors are required to comply fully with all applicable local and international laws                                 and regulations. AutoZone requires its vendors to provide products that have not been                                 produced using forced labor. Forced labor includes, but is not limited to, all forms of                                 slavery or practices similar to slavery, bonded labor, involuntary labor resulting from                                 trafficking, and labor subject to arbitrary abuse.All AutoZone                                     Vendors:AutoZone requires a Vendor Agreement for all of its                                 vendors—foreign and domestic. This agreement states that the vendor will indemnify                                 AutoZone if it does not comply fully with all applicable local and international laws                                 and regulations.AutoZone Distribution Centers:AutoZone                                 expects all loads coming into its distribution centers to be sealed by the vendors                                 according to AutoZone’s security procedures. AutoZone has policies and procedures                                 in place for the inspection of any loads arriving with seal discrepancies. Internally,                                 AutoZone inspects, secures, and seals all of its trailers between its distribution                                 centers, vendors, stores and other third parties. Each distribution center is fenced and                                 access controlled. Further, each distribution center has closed circuit television as                                 well as a security guard on duty at all times. AutoZone operates its own fleet,                                 excluding its Ontario, California distribution                                 center.ALLDATA:AutoZone, Inc. is the parent company of                                 ALLDATA LLC. ALLDATA LLC adheres to the same standards as AutoZone; however, ALLDATA                                 does not receive containers, and within the United States, it delivers a majority of its                                 database software products over the Internet and ships a small percentage of its                                 database software products in disc format via the United States Postal Service. In its                                 Vendor Agreement, ALLDATA requires its vendors to agree to take measures to ensure the                                 physical integrity and security of all shipments against the unauthorized introduction                                 of unauthorized personnel in transportation conveyances or containers.
