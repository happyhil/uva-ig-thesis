In the absence of a price suggested by the manufacturer or supplier, this price represents the highest price at which we offered or sold the product at some point in the past. For “Flash Deals”, where a product is temporarily being sold at a reduced price, an additional strikethrough price is presented that represents a recent previous price before the Flash Deal promotion. For members of the MyWay Program, if such higher price is accompanied by the MyWay logo, such price represents the offer price before applying MyWay Program benefits. The "Sale" tag on a product listing on our Site signifies that we are selling the product at a discount from a price in the previous 90 days. The Wayfair's Choice badge represents a shortlist of highly-rated, well-priced products we know customers love.When we use the term “Closeout,” we mean either that the product has been permanently reduced and will not return to the original price or that the product is temporarily being sold at a reduced price in order to clear an overstock of either Wayfair or supplier inventory. Prices of products listed on our Site as “Closeout” may fluctuate during the “Closeout” promotion period for such products. For temporary “Closeout” pricing, such products may return to prices that are equal to or greater than their original prices upon expiration of the applicable “Closeout” promotion period.We do not price match.

Regardless of the previous paragraphs, if Wayfair is found to be liable, our liability to you or to any third party is limited to the greater of (a) the amount in dispute not to exceed the total amount which you paid to us in the twelve (12) months prior to the action giving rise to the liability or (b) USD $100.Legal DisputesPLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. EXCEPT AS THE TERMS OF USE OTHERWISE PROVIDE, YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHTS TO TRY ANY CLAIM IN COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY AND TO BRING OR PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.Agreement to Binding ArbitrationAny dispute, claim or controversy between you and Wayfair, its agents, employees, officers, directors, principals, successors, assigns, subsidiaries or affiliates (collectively for purposes of this section, 'Wayfair') arising from or relating in any way to: (1) these Terms of Use and their interpretation or the breach, termination or validity thereof, and the relationships which result from these Terms of Use; (2) your use of any website owned or operated by Wayfair and its affiliated brands; or (3) any products or services sold or distributed by Wayfair and its affiliated brands or through any website owned or operated by Wayfair and its affiliated brands (collectively, “Covered Disputes”) will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court.The arbitrator also has the sole authority to and shall address all claims or arguments by both parties concerning the formation, legality, and enforceability of this arbitration clause, the scope of this clause, and the arbitrability of any claim or issue arising between us.There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of these Terms of Use as a court would.Sole Exceptions to ArbitrationNotwithstanding the foregoing, in lieu of arbitration: (1) either you or Wayfair can bring an individual claim in small claims court in the United States of America consistent with any applicable jurisdictional and monetary limits that may apply, provided that it is brought and maintained as an individual claim; and (2) you agree that you or Wayfair may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.Jury Trial and Class Action WaiverExcept as the Terms of Use otherwise provide, you and Wayfair acknowledge and agree that you are each waiving the right to a trial by jury and to the litigation of disputes in state or federal courts of general jurisdiction. The parties further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action/class arbitration or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. You and Wayfair may not be plaintiffs or class members in any purported class, collective, private attorney general, or representative proceeding, or otherwise make or proceed with any claim on a collective or consolidated basis, and may each bring claims against the other only in your or its individual capacity. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only on an individual basis and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual claim. Other rights that you would have if you went to court, such as access to discovery, also may be unavailable or limited in arbitration.Governing LawYou and Wayfair agree that any claim between us involves commerce under, and is governed exclusively by, the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA") and federal law, and not by any state or local laws, or the laws of other countries, concerning or purporting to place limits on the availability or scope of arbitration or in any way imposing requirements beyond or inconsistent with those set forth in the FAA. Where otherwise applicable, the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts apply.Initiating Arbitration and Arbitration RulesPrior to initiating any arbitration, the initiating party will give the other party at least 60-days' advance written notice of its intent to file for arbitration. Wayfair will provide such notice by email to your e-mail address on file with Wayfair and you must provide such notice by email to. During such 60-day notice period, the parties will endeavor to settle amicably by mutual discussions any Covered Disputes. Failing such amicable settlement and expiration of the notice period, either party may initiate arbitration.Any arbitration will be held before a single neutral arbitrator and will be governed by the Consumer Arbitration Rules and the Consumer Due Process Protocol (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") as currently in effect, and as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules are available online at, by calling the AAA at 800-778-7879, or by writing to the AAA Notice Address set forth below. To the extent that there is a conflict between this clause and the AAA Rules, the arbitrator shall resolve such conflicts so as to preserve the parties’ mutual obligation to arbitrate claims on an individual basis.To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to the AAA and to. The AAA’s address is: American Arbitration Association Case Filing Services, 1101 Laurel Oak Road, Suite 100, Voorhees, NJ 08043 (the “AAA Notice Address”). You may also send a copy to the AAA online at.You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.Arbitration FeesPayment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules. We will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. Likewise, Wayfair will not seek attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.We are committed to providing for dispute resolution at a reasonable cost to consumers consistent with the AAA Rules, and any matters related to such cost, if not agreed to by you and us, will be decided by the arbitrator.OtherTo the extent that any other provision of the Terms of Use is found to be inconsistent with rights, duties, and requirements of this arbitration agreement, or where the application of such a provision would change or render unenforceable any part of this arbitration agreement, such provision shall be null and void and the terms of this arbitration agreement shall control.TerminationYour ability to access and use the Sites remains in effect until terminated in accordance with these Terms of Use.

In the absence of a price suggested by the manufacturer or supplier, this price represents the highest price at which we offered or sold the product at some point in the past. For “Flash Deals”, where a product is temporarily being sold at a reduced price, an additional strikethrough price is presented that represents a recent previous price before the Flash Deal promotion. For members of the MyWay Program, if such higher price is accompanied by the MyWay logo, such price represents the offer price before applying MyWay Program benefits. The "Sale" tag on a product listing on our Site signifies that we are selling the product at a discount from a price in the previous 90 days. The Wayfair's Choice badge represents a shortlist of highly-rated, well-priced products we know customers love.When we use the term “Closeout,” we mean either that the product has been permanently reduced and will not return to the original price or that the product is temporarily being sold at a reduced price in order to clear an overstock of either Wayfair or supplier inventory. Prices of products listed on our Site as “Closeout” may fluctuate during the “Closeout” promotion period for such products. For temporary “Closeout” pricing, such products may return to prices that are equal to or greater than their original prices upon expiration of the applicable “Closeout” promotion period.We do not price match.

EXCEPT AS THE TERMS OF USE OTHERWISE PROVIDE, YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHTS TO TRY ANY CLAIM IN COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY AND TO BRING OR PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.Agreement to Binding ArbitrationAny dispute, claim or controversy between you and Wayfair, its agents, employees, officers, directors, principals, successors, assigns, subsidiaries or affiliates (collectively for purposes of this section, 'Wayfair') arising from or relating in any way to: (1) these Terms of Use and their interpretation or the breach, termination or validity thereof, and the relationships which result from these Terms of Use; (2) your use of any website owned or operated by Wayfair and its affiliated brands; or (3) any products or services sold or distributed by Wayfair and its affiliated brands or through any website owned or operated by Wayfair and its affiliated brands (collectively, “Covered Disputes”) will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court.The arbitrator also has the sole authority to and shall address all claims or arguments by both parties concerning the formation, legality, and enforceability of this arbitration clause, the scope of this clause, and the arbitrability of any claim or issue arising between us.There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of these Terms of Use as a court would.Sole Exceptions to ArbitrationNotwithstanding the foregoing, in lieu of arbitration: (1) either you or Wayfair can bring an individual claim in small claims court in the United States of America consistent with any applicable jurisdictional and monetary limits that may apply, provided that it is brought and maintained as an individual claim; and (2) you agree that you or Wayfair may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.Jury Trial and Class Action WaiverExcept as the Terms of Use otherwise provide, you and Wayfair acknowledge and agree that you are each waiving the right to a trial by jury and to the litigation of disputes in state or federal courts of general jurisdiction. The parties further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action/class arbitration or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. You and Wayfair may not be plaintiffs or class members in any purported class, collective, private attorney general, or representative proceeding, or otherwise make or proceed with any claim on a collective or consolidated basis, and may each bring claims against the other only in your or its individual capacity. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only on an individual basis and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual claim. Other rights that you would have if you went to court, such as access to discovery, also may be unavailable or limited in arbitration.Governing LawYou and Wayfair agree that any claim between us involves commerce under, and is governed exclusively by, the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA") and federal law, and not by any state or local laws, or the laws of other countries, concerning or purporting to place limits on the availability or scope of arbitration or in any way imposing requirements beyond or inconsistent with those set forth in the FAA. Where otherwise applicable, the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts apply.Initiating Arbitration and Arbitration RulesPrior to initiating any arbitration, the initiating party will give the other party at least 60-days' advance written notice of its intent to file for arbitration. Wayfair will provide such notice by email to your e-mail address on file with Wayfair and you must provide such notice by email to. During such 60-day notice period, the parties will endeavor to settle amicably by mutual discussions any Covered Disputes. Failing such amicable settlement and expiration of the notice period, either party may initiate arbitration.Any arbitration will be held before a single neutral arbitrator and will be governed by the Consumer Arbitration Rules and the Consumer Due Process Protocol (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") as currently in effect, and as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules are available online at, by calling the AAA at 800-778-7879, or by writing to the AAA Notice Address set forth below. To the extent that there is a conflict between this clause and the AAA Rules, the arbitrator shall resolve such conflicts so as to preserve the parties’ mutual obligation to arbitrate claims on an individual basis.To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to the AAA and to. The AAA’s address is: American Arbitration Association Case Filing Services, 1101 Laurel Oak Road, Suite 100, Voorhees, NJ 08043 (the “AAA Notice Address”). You may also send a copy to the AAA online at.You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.Arbitration FeesPayment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules. We will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. Likewise, Wayfair will not seek attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.We are committed to providing for dispute resolution at a reasonable cost to consumers consistent with the AAA Rules, and any matters related to such cost, if not agreed to by you and us, will be decided by the arbitrator.OtherTo the extent that any other provision of the Terms of Use is found to be inconsistent with rights, duties, and requirements of this arbitration agreement, or where the application of such a provision would change or render unenforceable any part of this arbitration agreement, such provision shall be null and void and the terms of this arbitration agreement shall control.TerminationYour ability to access and use the Sites remains in effect until terminated in accordance with these Terms of Use.
